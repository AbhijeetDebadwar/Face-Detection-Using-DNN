Face Detection Using DNN (Caffe Model)

This model was included in OpenCV from version 3.3. It is based on Single-Shot-Multibox detector and uses ResNet-10 Architecture as the backbone. The model was trained using images available from the web.
OpenCV provides 2 models for this face detector.
1. Floating point 16 version of the original caffe implementation
2. 8 bit quantized version using Tensorflow

I have used original caffee implementation in the code.
